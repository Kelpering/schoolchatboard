# schoolchatboard
- Will allow the user to chat with anyone using the same computer at different times
- Easily expandable to a real database and server with users able to chat in real time with eachother

## Purpose
The purpose of this was to demonstrate a clear, concise, and nice looking chatboard that, if provided the resources, could be
expanded to a real website and server. The project will allow users to chat and will not reset upon the website being closed
but when the clear button is clicked
## Goal
The goal of this project was to create an easily expandable website that would be simple to expand into a full website if
given the resources. The website was also designed to accept different user names and text of any size, overflow does not
break the website but instead will allow scrolling when needed.
